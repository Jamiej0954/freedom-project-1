<hr>
<p>A serial killers are define as a person who murders three or more people, usually in service of abnormal psychological gratification.</p>
<p>
A serial killer chooses their victims carefully and this is based on the victim’s availability, vulnerability, and desirability.
</p>

<p>
  <ol>
  Availability- The lifestyle of the victim that made it easier for a killer to attack.
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  <ol>
  Vulnerability- An extent to which the victim to defendless to certain risk.
  </ol>
  </p>
<p>
  <ol>
  Desirability- The appeal or attractiveness of the victim is to the serial killer and this can be based on many factors: race, ethnicity, gender, age, etc. 
</ol>

<p>Serial killers have low orbital cortex activity. This is the area that is believed to be involved with ethical behavior, more decision making, and impulse control. 
</p>
<img class="d-block w-100" src="Neurology.jpg" alt="...">
<br>
<p>Low activity in this region means there's less normal suppression of behaviors, including rage, violence, eating, sex, and drinking.
</p>
<p>The study showed that psychopaths have reduced connections between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), the part of the brain responsible for sentiments such as empathy and guilt, and the amygdala, which mediates fear and anxiety.
</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    When it comes to childhood, serial killers are more likely to have experienced child abuse than society in general.They generally kill during a cycle when they're feeling stress, and feel temporarily relieved after they commit the homicide. 
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    The motivations of serial killers vary, but they often fall into these four categories: 
  </ol>
  <p>
    <ol>
      Obtaining money, experiencing the thrill, a sense of power, and a desire to rid the world of evildoers.
    </ol>
  </p>

<h5>The Three Distinct Brain Region</h5>
<hr>
<p>One of the core discoveries involved abnormalities in three distinct brain regions involved in regulating emotions: the anterior cingulate cortex, the orbital frontal cortex, and the amygdala. The anterior cingulate cortex works to communicate with and recruit other brain regions in response to conflict, while the orbital frontal cortex is involved with ethical behavior, moral decision-making, and impulse control; it works to moderate and constrain our impulsive outbursts. 
</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    Diminished or entirely absent brain activity in the orbital cortex region while the amygdala showed normal and sometimes heightened activity. This imbalance, and the inability of the two brain regions to effectively counteract each other, may help explain how threatening situations can become explosive in some people.
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    When there’s an imbalance of brain activity to which the orbital cortex isn’t doing its job, the area of the brain that drives your impulsive behaviors will take over. People with low activity in the orbital frontal cortex are either freewheeling types or sociopaths.
  </ol>
</p>
<br>
<p>The amygdala is involved with aggression, fear, and other emotional processing.
</p>

<p>There is however significant variation in the prevalence of childhood abuse across studies (Beasley, 2004, Mitchell and Aamodt, 2005). Hickey (1997) reported that among a group of 62 male serial killers, 48% had been rejected as children by a parent or some other important person in their lives. Research into the impact of childhood abuse and neglect on violent behavior of adults who became serial killers concluded that adults who had been physically, sexually, and emotionally abused as children were three times more likely than non-abused adults to act violently as adults.
